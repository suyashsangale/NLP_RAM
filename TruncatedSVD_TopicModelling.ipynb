It \\'s unfortunate that tuition has skyrocketed and outpaced inflation for the current generation, but using today \\'s dollar figures and attaching them to XX/XX/XXXX is just absurd. Although it is challenging to take any of this seriously, the fact is that ECMC will again go on to contact my work, and I am mired in a process in which I can not get them to leave me alone, even though I have responded to the shifted burden of proof in this country and demonstrated that I DO NOT OWE anything. The burden of proof should require debt verification and validation on ECMC \\'s part, but yet again, here we are with their incapability of providing a proper mailing. I have an existing \" Notice of Intent to Sue \\'\\' for the State of California, and I intend to go to court over this matter. I fundamentally believe that ECMC needs to be investigated for financial fraud. I do not know why this organization has my information, and I do not know why they are creating fake documents to attempt to harass me and my employer. I work for a XXXX, and we do n\\'t have time to be dealing with this for several hours each week. At first, I just wanted this to stop, but now I want compensatory and punitive damages. After all of this time ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ), the individuals working for ECMC have still failed to provide a legal debt instrument. To now include a letter stating that an attachment is included that is n\\'t does n\\'t seem like a mistake to me. I WANT THEM TO INCLUDE ATTACHMENT A IN RESPONSE TO THE CFPB. I have included the original scanned document with the envelope and postdate. I want proof of the existence and enforceability of a valid debt. When they fail to produce this again, I want my information removed from their database with a letter from them indicating that they have done so.',\n",

Meaning, a qualifying nonprofit, federal, local, state, or tribal government. \\n\\nThe program started in 2007, so the first debt was set to be forgiven this coming fall. \\n\\nLast year a small group of borrowers learned that their eligibility for the program had revoked.

Searching my computer, I found, scan and send communications, with Pioneer on BOTH XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Had to send twice because Pioneer could not open a word document. I made monthly arrangements and did not miss a payment, for the 9 or 10 months agreed upon. Pioneer cancelled my payments and then put wage garnishments on me. Without notification! I have no problem repaying my student loans, but to be belittled by XXXX and called a liar are beyond me. I reached out to Pioneer to resolve the wage garnishments and was told the only way to cease garnishment was to make payments on top of monthly wage garnishments. Well, if that is the case, I 'll just allow the garnishments to continue until the debt is paid. But I will not tolerate abusive communication from XXXX.

We no longer wanted a hard line phone as we did n\\'t use it, it was a total annoyance, and my wife and I both had mobile phones. \\nI got in touch with XXXX and explained to them my desire to discontinue our telephone service. ( I \\'ve had this telephone for over 40 years. ) XXXX said that they could remove the phone line but they would only credit our monthly service bill for only {$4.00}. Our bills indicated that XXXX was charging us {$30.00} per month for just the telephone service. Due to length of time we were clients, we were no longer under any kind of service contract with them. We decided that XXXX was only interested in bilking us for service we no longer wanted or needed. They were also providing us with a very slow internet speed, a service they no longer, in fact, provided to new clients because, \" It was too slow \\'\\'. My wife and I decided that it was time to leave XXXX because we no longer felt they were being ethical or reasonable in their business dealings with us. We found another XXXX who would provide excellent service, at a charge far less than XXXX, and treat us with respect and honesty. We ceased using XXXX services on XX/XX/2017. \\nI called XXXX to discontinue service with them and return their modem, which I did immediately. At the very end of my conversation with the service representative to close our account he told me that XXXX would charge us {$150.00}. for a disconnection fee. I have been with the company for over 12+ years, we did not have a current service contract with XXXX , nor any written or verbal agreement that there would be any disconnection fees applied to us whatsoever. I asked XXXX to provide proof of this \" contract \\'\\'. They never provided proof of a contract as they promised to do. Is this their way of conducting business with long-term clients? \\nXXXX followed up by only sending us a non-itemized bill in an attempt to bury this fraudulent charge inside our final bill, without ever providing us with any proof of our responsibility for such a contract charge. They are not being ethical in dealing with us. \\nThey have not sent the proof we requested, but instead have turned the matter over to a collection agency. We absolutely dispute that after over 12 years service we were still under a \" contract \\'\\'. This is a false claim on their part. Plus they are not furnishing us with a bill that itemizes and dates all charges. I find this a rather unsavory way to conduct business, especially with a long-term client. \\nYesterday, we received a letter from a collection agency working for XXXX without any itemization or explanation of charges. Just a final bill amount, without any documentation, nor \" proof \\'\\' of a \" contract \\'\\' which XXXX claims we had, but will not show us. How can we know what we are being charged for? We were also informed by a XXXX telephone agent over 6 months ago that we were \" no longer under any contract with them currently \\'\\'. \\n\\nHow do we go about having this {$150.00}. unsubstantiated charge for disconnection by XXXX dismissed? XXXX refuses to deal with this matter in a civilized way. \\nThey are demanding payment for something that they have not provided evidence of. This is unprofessional and arrogant on their part. We have always dealt with them in an ethical manner, they are not responding in kind. \\nIn my research on XXXX on the web I \\'ve noticed that XXXX has a multitude of lawsuits against them for their poor business practices all over the USA.

Also, I only received notification of this alleged debt after receiving a phone call from this company, on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a letter be mailed to me in regards to this matter. I never received such letter. As I was contacted less than 21 days after the payment was allegedly made, there was no attempt to resolve this matter within the credit union. I was not allocated the full thirty calendar days to dispute this alleged debt. as it has been now over sixty calendar days, and I still have not received formal notice by postal mail, this alleged debt is hereby invalid. As you mentioned in your previous answer to the CFPB, my address was considered as \" invalid \\'\\', according to your company. As an alleged collector of debts, my address could have been obtained by contacting the credit union itself or by conducting \" skip tracing \\'\\' with the credit bureaus.

The XXXX COURT/XXXX CA DISTRICT sent me a letter from the County Clerk \\'s Office stating that at no given time do they report to any of the XXXX Credit Bureaus. I also put a security freeze on all of the major data mining companies like XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and I have sent letters recently to XXXX XXXX. I will include them in the documentation portion. \\n\\nI have sent a formal notice to all XXXX Credit Bureaus and made XXXX CFPB complaints concerning their verification process of XXXX, Transunion and XXXX. I am a Deputy Sheriff for over 20 years experience I want to give you an example please indulge me If I make a traffic stop and the dispatcher says that person has a bench warrant but for me I have to verify the warrant The dispatcher just looking at the screen and see the information it is not verified. She has to pull the actual warrant info with the signature of the judge. Then I can make the arrest. \\n\\nThe XXXX bureaus use these data mining companies and using info on a screen that they can not be verified thru the courts the letter states that and I have put security freezes on all other entities and CB \\'s sometime do not give you the needed info required from the FCRA on who verified, name, phone number, name of company etc. \\n\\nI asked Transunion verification made pursuant to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Please note that I am requesting \" Verification \\'\\' that is competent evidence bearing my signature showing that I have or ever had a Bankruptcy. An Employee looking at their computer screen seeing my name listed in their database is \" NOT \\' verification or validation which is two different things of any Bankruptcy. Verfication accordance to XXXX XXXX is ... ... .. averment that the party pleading is ready to establish the truth of what he has set forth. Also it goes on to say The examination of a writing for the purpose of ascertaining its truth ; or a certificate or affidavit that it is true. The court said Verification and Confirmation of the correctness, truth or authenticity of a pleading, account or other paper by an affidavit, oath or deposition XXXX v XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; And XXXX v XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX v XXXX , XXXX App. Div. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX This is my argument concerning Transunion verification process ; Verfication is sworn testimony it can be testimony in a deposition or in a court or an affidavit ; The only testimony that is admissible is testimony from a witness with First Hand Knowledge. A County Clerk does not have firsthand knowledge nor does anyone at the county recorder, nor does anyone at the credit bureaus. If someone verifies but they XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX etc. The main public record source for the credit bureaus. if someone verifies but they do n\\'t have firsthand knowledge then its not verification its Hearsay. And hearsay is inadmissible and the court says its in competent. The negative mark found on my credit reports XXXX, XXXX, and Transunion. So in conclusion if you can not legally validate and verify which they have now legally accomplished they should immediately deleted this from my credit file which has been detrimental to my likelihood and my credit score.',\n",

My loans had defaulted due to the fact that I had been in an accident with my XXXX causing me to be out of work because I was recovering from my injuries for several months. At the time, I was an XXXX. I was no longer able to work for myself, so I lost my XXXX. During this time, my wife divorced me because I was n't making enough money for her. I had to sell our home and move because she wanted the money and then I had child support payments for XXXX children as well. I had completely lost everything that I loved and I had very little money. I also lost my car. I had to file bankruptcy and try to get back on my feet. I do apologize that I allowed my loans to go into default, but I tried to reach out for help with no avail. When the letter came from Delta Management, I called and asked how I could get my XXXX loans out of default XX/XX/XXXX. The Delta Management rep told me that I had to agree to have my payments automatically deducted from my paycheck and that after 6 months of consistent payments they will take my XXXX loans out of default. So, I agreed and also I agreed to pay 4 payments each month instead of 1 payment in the hopes that I would decrease my balance owed quicker and show my willingness to pay. However, although I have been paying voluntarily, consistently 4 payments each month since XX/XX/XXXX, I have not had my loans taken out of default. I am a military veteran and I am currently in the process of purchasing a home for myself and my new wife, but the loan officer pulled my credit report and showed me that my XXXX student loans are still on my credit report in default status. I was made aware that I can not get a VA Loan unless my loans are out of default. I have paid what I agreed to with Delta Management and am still paying, yet nothing on their end has changed. I feel that I was defrauded by Delta Management and lied to by them just to get my money.

I say this because my account was placed under AAFES Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program initially in XXXX because AAFES placed my account in collections after they increased my monthly payments without notification then locked me out of accessing my account because I was no longer in the Military. I got out the military in XXXX XXXX and had my account on auto-pay for AAFES to withdraw {$120.00} per month ( my minimum payment each month was about {$80.00} ). I later found out that my account was over 90 days past due because AAFES had increased my payments without notifying me to {$180.00} per month ; so although my direct payments of {$120.00} was received on time every month it was still in default because of a {$60.00} shortage. No notification was received from AAFES to inform me of my new monthly payment amount, nor did AAFES ever send me any notification that my account was past due. I found out of the delinquent account after trying to obtain credit and the creditor informed me that I had a past due account. Once I found out, I attempted to access my AAFES account online and realized that I no longer had access. I called AAFES and was told that since I was no longer in the Military my access was revoked. I explained to the representative that my access was limited after I got out the Military but I was given access to view my statements and pay on my account online. The representative told me that AAFES had revised that policy and so the only way I could access my account was by paper statements. I informed the representative that I had not received any paper statements and she told me that they would send XXXX out. I then asked how could I pay my account and I was told that the only way to correct it is to pay the full balance or settle through the Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program. This program required that I call every month to pay my bills. I complied with the rules of this program every month for the past 3.5 years. When I called to pay my bill in XXXX XXXX, AAFES notified me that they were making it easier for consumers to pay their debt so I could set up auto-pay which would relieve me of calling monthly. I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments thinking that AAFES had finally gotten better. Now I 'm finding out that this was a plight to defraud me and keep me in debt once again. \\n\\nI requested to have my account set up on auto-payments where payments of {$180.00} would be debited from my bank account on the XXXX of every month. My XXXX XXXX statement showed that the money was debited as requested on the XXXX XXXX and my next withdrawal was set up for XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX after returning from a 10 day vacation out of State, I received a statement from AAFES which was postmarked XXXX XXXX, XXXX. That statement showed that my account was 30 days past due in the amount of {$180.00} ; a fee of {$25.00} was added for NSF and my XXXX XXXX payment was reversed. I immediately checked my bank statement to see what was going on and verified that there was more than enough money in my account for AAFES to electronically pull the {$180.00} payment which they reported as NSF and charged me a {$25.00} NSF fee. I immediately called AAFES to find out why they charged me a NSF fee and reversed my payment if there was more than enough funds in my account.

Per the military clause in our lease agreement we needed to provide the orders to the leasing office and give a 30 day move out this ensures the lease would be terminated properly without additional money being due ( i.e re-letting fee ). I followed the exact process and my move out was approved. During my final month in the apartment as I was packing I received a knock at the door it was the Sheriff bringing eviction paperwork. I informed the sheriff I was moving due to a PCS ( permanent change of station ) ordered by the military and he instructed me to go file an answer with the courthouse. I did just that. I brought the eviction paperwork from the sheriff, our orders, & the letter from the apartments approving the move out and the case was dismissed and we were allowed to continue our move out as scheduled without harassment.

Since that time we have been trying without resolution to get answers and get this debt removed. This debt has destroyed both mine and my husbands credit. I believe due to my personal history with XXXX XXXX that she decided to furnish false documents to hinder us from being able to rent anywhere in the state of XXXX. I believe this to be the product of malicious intent because again we followed the law, the case was dismissed and nothing was ever reported until after we needed to use them as a reference. To date, we have been denied credit, apartments and a mortgage loan due to this action and on top of that our score has plummeted several points.

Upon learning about this situation, I contacted the agency XXXX XXXX in an effort to resolve this. I agreed to make an automatic payment of {$740.00} as was required and received a confirmation # by the representative : Confirmation # : XXXX. Subsequently I received another call from the same CPA representative that the payment had not processed. I immediately called my bank and was informed that they had in fact received the request for payment which had been approved but that they had XXXX48 hours with which to process the payment. I shared this information with the CPA representative who spoke to his Supervisor and it was agreed they would wait until the next day. I also asked the Representative if my case had been reported to the Credit Bureau as I had never been informed about this debt. He answered it had not yet been sent but was glad I was trying to correct the situation. Next day XXXX XXXX, I received another call from CPA that the payment had not been processed and that I would have to give them the information again. I explained the Bank informed me the payment had been approved and that the merchant ( CPA ) would have to release the hold in order to receive the payment. This was explained to the CPA representative who then informed they did have problems with their system and had been unable to receive the payment. Nonetheless, they still needed my credit card information to reprocess the payment. At this point i decided to contact the local XXXX XXXX and informed them of my efforts to make restitution on the account. My case was referred to the Supervisor who was going to inquire into the situation with CPA. I received another call from CPA, this time from the representative 's Supervisor who explained they had not received the payment and that I would have to provide the same information to reprocess the amount owed as the CPA representatives do not keep the credit/debit card information shared by individuals on file. I questioned this as I did not want to make duplicate payments for XXXX debt ; she explained that once the information was sent back to the Bank, they would only process XXXX payment. I agreed to provide the information and received a confirmation number for this transaction : # XXXX. I immediately contacted the bank to inform them of this situation. I was informed I would have to wait at least 7 days for the first debit to be canceled since CPA had submitted another request. I asked they make sure XXXX payments are not processed, only XXXX. My concern is that despite being told my situation would not be reported to the Credit Bureau, it was. I received an email from my ID CARE ( Identity Fraud Protection Program ) dated XXXX XXXX, that here had been a change in my credit information which turned out to be a debt report for the above-mentioned situation.

I also offered my social security number to help verify any assets, or banking records to confirm my present financial condition again no assistance or response.When I agreed to the credit contract I could not afford to repay and the creditor knew this. I have however stood in honor and have paid what im able too under the most extraneous conditions. It is also my contention that the debt collector is a third party interloper on this matter with no lawful standing. Nor are they a bona fide party to any contract in which I am also a party, an agent of a bona fide party to any contractin which I am also a party, a holder in due course of any debt to which I am obligated or has shown evidence of the validity of the original contract, and that their claim is or was fraudulent.They also have not display a license or bond Showing that they are a bona fide agent, registered with the state which they must produce. I also challenge their authority to use my title/trust name in their correspondence. The Markind Law Group made a claim against my estate in which they are not the superior title holder. I am the holder in due course, they do not have a superior claim.When challenged on this aspect of their claim again vagueness and a lack of a coherent, competent response. I also contend that the alleged debt was never assessed under penalty and perjury, or verified under oath thus not a true bill in commerce.I dclare that I do not nor did I ever act as surety for the en legis artificial title.

I elected to pay for and maintain my civilian coverage while on XXXX XXXX to allow my family to keep our same providers and use my military insurance as secondary coverage. It states in the letter that my payments are scheduled to be taken out of my check and that I would maintain the pretax benefit with that. I elected to let that procedure take place as outlined in the letter. I was back at the USDA from XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ; I then went on XXXX XXXX for XXXX more weeks from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. I then returned to the USDA on XXXX XXXX XXXX and stayed there until I was activated on the orders that I am on now ; XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. \\nXX/XX/XXXX I received the attached letter from the Treasury Dept. that stated I owed {$660.00} and listed a website and a telephone number. The website seemed suspect to me and was asking for all my personal information, so I called the phone number on the letter and left messages there, with no response. The letter also stated on the top my debit was {$660.00}, but at the bottom payment coupon it says I owe {$850.00}. I contacted my supervisor at the USDA and he contacted one of the USDA PR personnel that are located in XXXX. They both advised me to wait until they checked it out to make sure it was legitimate. \\nNext, I received a phone call on my cell phone from Pioneer Credit (? ) asking if I was who I am, what was my birthdate, address and last XXXX of my SS. Of course I was very wary of answering, but then he told me my last XXXX! He wanted me to send them a copy of my orders and I told him the USDA had copies of my orders and if they sent him to me, they can give him copies of my orders. This is what rekindled my efforts at finding out what is going on, so I contacted my USDA Supervisor and the USDA PR person. The PR person sent me the information attached dated XX/XX/XXXX that outlined my medical insurance payments and what is still due.

In Texas the homestead is exempt and I have requested a release by them as i sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX as I believed still lawyer of record which is still unclear. You may deem me a failure to pay a debt but I fought in court against their law firm and defeated them 4 times in court. I deny the debt and I believe that the court granted it in error. I would not arbitrate as I again deny this debt. I however assert that it is an illegal practices to engage in a blatant disregard to a Texas law which identifies in the real estate codes what is admissible to seek actions for assets retrievable. Thus the financial institution with their law firm issued an Abstract Judgment as though there were no restrictions that were not within the guidelines of their reach. In my opinion this has been a long time practice of illegal actions and both parties have committed a crime. I have not committed a crime in the eyes of the law and which I deny I owe. I believe that they use intimidation, coercion, and reckless regard for the Texas Homestead Exemption to collect on legitimate or illegitimate debts via Abstract Judgments. I believe that since the statue of limitations can go on for 20 years that the crime has strong possibilities that past and future debt holders have or might pay is considerable and undeserving.',\n",
       " 'A fitness club had a clause in their contract saying if you cancel within three business days you are not obligated to pay anything. If you go past these three days then cancel you pay {$300.00} dollars or so. \\n\\nOn the third day ( within the acceptable window ) I called in to the fitness club and asked what would be the appropriate steps to cancel the contract.

I received another generic email, which did not dispute or even acknowledge anything I said about the verbal agreement, and stated I still owe {$300.00}.

A man on the other end asked, \" Is this XXXX? \\'\\' I said, \" Yes. \\'\\' The man then said, \" What is your birth date? \\'\\' I replied, \" Who is this? \\'\\' The man said, \" I am not going to tell you until you give me your birth date. \\'\\' I said, \" I am not going to give out my birth date to someone who wo n\\'t even identify themselves. \\'\\' The man then said, \" This is XXXX. \\'\\' I then recalled that I had spoken in the past to a man named XXXX with XXXX. I said, \" Is this XXXX with XXXX? \\'\\' He replied, \" No, I am with Alpha. \\'\\' I then said, \" I remember you. We have spoken before. \\'\\' I then gave him my birth date. XXXX XXXX never disclosed he was calling to collect a debt. I had to guess and figure out who he was and why he was calling. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX with Alpha Recovery Corp informed me that my current payment arrangement had expired and I needed to pay the entire debt off now. I told him I was not able to do that and would need to continue the payments. I asked XXXX, \" Who is XXXX? \\'\\' I asked him this because when the payments are taken out of my account my account shows the payments are going to a company named XXXX. XXXX XXXX told me his client was XXXX XXXX, which I know is not true. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX would not disclose how much I owed on the account nor would he provide a settlement amount. He did however keep insisting I use a credit card to charge a settlement amount to them. He threw out percentages, but never talked numbers. I have had this conversation with XXXX XXXX before and I informed him once again, that I was not going to charge an amount I would not be able to pay and get into financial trouble again. XXXX XXXX then said, \" So you are refusing to pay? \\'\\' I explained to him I was not refusing to pay, but needed to continue a payment arrangement to which he just hung up on me. \\n\\nThe next day, XXXX XXXX I called Alpha Recovery and requested that I be able to speak to someone other than XXXX XXXX about my account. I was put on hold and transferred to XXXX XXXX so I hung up. I also called Alpha \\'s complaint line and left a message, but never received a call back. I sent an email to their corporate office to no avail. \\n\\nAfter paying on the XXXX XXXX collections debt for nine years I think it is possible this debt is paid off! Yet, Alpha Recovery now has the debt and will not provide me with information nor have I been able to speak with someone who is reasonable and honest.',\n",
