       " 'To Whom  it May Concern, Summary : I am  writing in regards to a recent re-finance that my husband and I engaged in on our commercial property. For the purposes of the refinance we moved our mortgage away from City National Bank to a new bank. My complaints are in regards to :  ( 1 ) t he opacity and one-sided nature of the City National Bank yield maintenance pre-pay penalty language as presented in our original note ( dated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   )  and  ( 2 ) City National Ba nks failure to honor the prepay penalty amount in their original demand lett er ( d ated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   ) d espite the fact that the re-fi transaction closed within 30 days.       Timeline of events and corresponding attachments, from  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX - XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  : - XX/XX/XXXX  : We move our mortgage on our property to City National Bank  .  Attachment  # 1 is the Property Deed   between our family trust and City National Bank dated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , and signed by my husband and myself. Please notice the pre-pay language that stretches for  XXXX  pages, from the end of Page  XXXX  to the end of page  XXXX . Section  XXXX  is of particular importance for the sake of this discussion.     Fast forward more than 2 years later - XX/XX/XXXX  -  XX/XX/XXXX  : We are unable to agree to new re-fi terms with City National B ank so my hus band and I decide to take our business to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . On numerous occasions I asked about the pre-pay penalty calculation. I would think that as a fairly educated person I should be able to calculate the penalty amount on my own, but this was not the case. My colleagues and I all came up with different numbers ( all folks with MBAs in finance by the way ). When I aske d City National to  calculate it for me it would take days and sometimes weeks, after multiple requests, to receive a response.     - XX/XX/XXXX  : City National bank furnishes the attached demand letter addressed to th e Title Company   ( Attachment # 2 )  dated  XX/XX/XXXX  in which our pre-pay penalty for re-financing our property is {$5200.00}. The letter has no expiration date and provides a calculation for each day beyond the  XXXX  day. Given the fact that it is industry-standard practice that these demands are good for 30 days, and no expiry is provided, we considered their demand to be final. As any rational consumer would do, we then based our financial plans and final loan agreement with  XXXX   XXXX  on all the demand letters submitted, including this one from City National Bank for the pre-pay penalty of {$5200.00}.     - XX/XX/XXXX  : Roughly 27 days following the date of that pre-pay demand letter fro m City National  we close. The closing statement dated  XXXX  is attachment  # 3. No te that the pre-pay penalty of {$5200.00} corresponds to the  XXXX  City National Bank pre-pay letter.     - XX/XX/XXXX  : The Title company is contacted by City National Ba nk saying that the pre-pay penalty amount wired needed to be updated to reflect the increase in interest rates and threa tens to return the wired funds if the balance is not paid immediately. An updated demand letter is produced by CNB. See attachment  # 4 for t he new demand in addition to attachment  # 5 for t he correspondence betwee n the Title co mpany and City National Bank. Attachment #  6 is  the final closing statement provided b y Title d ated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX . Notice that it does not correspond to the  XXXX  revised CNB demand letter. There was so much confusion caused by the calculation in the  XX/XX/XXXX  note, even internally at CNB, that the final calculation would change daily and sometimes multiple times in the same day during this period. Eventually the prepay penalty balance due arrived at a total of {$6300.00 } ( or  {$11000.00}, the new pre-pay penalty, minus the amount already wired, {$5200.00}  )  - XX/XX/XXXX  : I am notified by my banker at  XXXX   XXXX  that we must furnish an additional balance due to  City National on a ccount of the pre-pay penalty change. My reaction was utter disgust. First City National Bank designs its prepay penalty language to be so confusing as to be unintelligible to even someone with above average intelligence and an  XXXX . And, on top of riduculous math, the language is written in such a way that  City National c an capitalize on swings that give them a favorable outcome, but we as the borrower fail to receive the same consideration. Would CNB be chasing us down for a refund had interest rates gone the other way or would they claim they could not due to administrative convenienc e ( Section   XXXX  )? I am confident it would be the latter. Then, to change the pre-pay penalty owed AFTER WE CLOSED even though we closed within the industry standard 30 days? How can any average consumer or business owner make plans if the amounts owed are a moving target?     - XX/XX/XXXX  : For 3 days I attempt to reach a favorable resolution with City National Bank and unable to do so. Title wires {$6300.00} on  XXXX  so that the transaction can be completed,  XXXX   XXXX  can move into first lien-holder position and to prevent return of all wires. I cut a check the same day to the title company for {$6300.00}.     Conclusion : City National Bank acted deceptively. Their contractual language is purposely confusing and rigged to favor City National Bank depending on the circumstances. Same goes for their pre-pay demand letter. I would like to understand what recourse I have in recovering the additional balance of {$6300.00}.',\n",
       " 'This complaint is regarding the hardship paperwork process After several follow up calls that documents were received and completed, we were requested to provide additional information and documents. Part of these documents requested was information regarding the receipt of Social Security ( SS ) benefits. As explained and noted on our file we are not receiving SS benefits and as such were instructed to provide a letter signed and dated by both borrower to this affect. I have on XX/XX/XXXX submitted the signed and dated letter confirming we are not receiving SS benefits. \\nAfter another follow up with their customer support reps we were informed to revise our income statement to remove the SS information to move the process along as well as additional banking statements etc. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we completed and submitted via fax all remaining and requested documents which included an updated income form removing SS benefits incorrectly listed. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX after not receiving notice of any kind include written that we needed to provide additional information I called and spoke with a female customer support rep who instructed that they were still waiting for the singed letter confirming no SS benefits were being received. I informed her at this time that was faxed on XX/XX/XXXX and the revised income form was sent via fax on XX/XX/XXXX. She confirmed these documents were received and informed me that loss mitigation did not update their system to reflect the received documents. She stated she would email and get the issue corrected to move our file to under writing. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called again because again I had received no notifications of any kind that our file had been sent to the underwriters. I reached the rep XXXX ID # XXXX who stated again that they were waiting for the confirmation letter signed and dated by both borrower regarding the SS benefits. Again I instructed him I have already taken care of this and that they had the required documents as previously discussed on XX/XX/XXXX with the prior rep. \\nI asked why this had not been processed and what I needed to do to get this fixed as our deadline of XX/XX/XXXX was fast approaching. He stated he would escalate the issue to the loss mitigation team personally and get this corrected and would call me back the following day to update me. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received the call back from XXXX ID # XXXX to be told that the loss mitigation department is requiring the letter confirming we are not receiving the SS benefits be submitted. Again I state that was done and he confirmed he had the document in their system, but that was what he was being told by loss mitigation. I requested clarification as to why I have to resubmit a document already in their system, XXXX became annoyed and said thats just what they are requesting and thats what they are telling me. I asked to speak with a supervisor and received push back before being transferred to a random persons voice mail. I left a message and still have not received a call back as of this complaint date of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI immediately began the long process of calling them back and after 20 minutes was able to speak with rep XXXX ID # XXXX. After going again through the entire issues he instructed me he would again escalate the issue and notify the loss mitigation team that the documents were received and they needed to update the system and process to under writing. This is now 2 weeks beyond their 5-7 business day processing time frame that this was supposed to be done by and 3 reps in who stated they would escalate the issue and resolve. To confirm this would be done I requested to speak with a supervisor, again received push back and again insisted I speak with them. I was able to speak with a XXXX XXXX who stated she was part of the management team and after again explaining the issues and my concerns was told she would include the loss mitigation management team to the email notification. After requesting a call back she stated they dont do that. Even though XXXX was able to do so I just let that go and stated I would be calling the next day to verify this has been done. \\n\\nBefore I could call the following day I received a collection call from AmeriHomes made by rep. XXXX ID # XXXX who informed me that even though we have not yet defaulted on our loan we had been placed on a collections call list with AmeriHome Mortgage. \\nI did not let him off the phone instead took this opportunity to confirm that the notes had been added to my file as XXXX XXXX stated and that my issues were sent to management as stated as well. He informed me that loss mitigation has not updated my file as required and that they did not see an email to the management team. After a long conversation XXXX XXXX stated he had included his manager XXXX XXXX to the situation and that he would meet with the loss mitigation managers XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, not sure on this name ) and that someone would be calling me back to address and correct ASAP. \\n\\nCome XXXX Arizona time on XX/XX/XXXX no call back so I called again to verify what is happening with our file. I spoke with rep XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX and was again instructed they were waiting for documents already received and that the system had not been updated and saw no notes from XXXX XXXX or other management team members. She immediately got a supervisor involved a XXXX XXXX who promised to speak with XXXX XXXX and the management team of loss mitigation and would call me back ASAP same day. No call back nothing as of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWe are now 3 weeks behind on getting our hardship request to the underwriter who has 30 days to process the request and approve or deny and this is because the loss mitigation department has failed to hold to their 5-7 day requirement and promise to customer to review and update the file. Not to mention the fact we are receiving collection calls for a debt we have not defaulted on as of today.',\n",

       " \"I recently did a refinance on my XXXX mortgage with XXXX ( I believe it was a HARP refi ) and they were able to get my interest rate down to 4.25 % from 6.75 %. This reduced my payment by {$500.00} per month ( Kudos to XXXX ). But the problem that I have is actually with my XXXX mortgage which is with Citibank. With Citibank, I am stuck in a 8.125 % interest rate loan with huge balloon payment due in 5 years. Over the past 10 years, I have only managed to pay {$5700.00} in principal against the original {$57000.00}. Aside from the {$15.00} in interest I pay on a daily basis, I ca n't see how I will make the balloon payment unless I win the lottery. The loan was part of an XXXX piggyback deal predicated on the market going up. When the market tanked, my house lost half its value and I am still underwater. When I called Citibank on XXXX at XXXX PDT I spoke to XXXX different representatives : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. It was very confusing being transferred between departments. They kept asking for the same information which I provided XXXX different times counting the automated system. The end result was XXXX telling me that Citibank ca n't help me.\",\n",

       " 'I have a mortgage with Seterus, Inc. - payments due on the XXXX of each month. In XXXX 2015 I began paying a few days before the XXXX of the month. I paid the XXXX bill on XXXX, the XXXX bill on XXXX, and the XXXX bill on XXXX. However, part of the payment made on XXXX was applied toward fees and the remainder toward the principle and I was not credited for a mortgage payment. When I paid the XXXX bill on XXXX it was credited toward the XXXX bill, even though I had paid the XXXX bill on XXXX, and I was charged a late fee. I did not notice this until I went to pay the XXXX bill on XXXX and saw that I still had an outstanding payment for XXXX, although I had paid this bill on XXXX. As such, I reviewed my statements and determined that the payment made on XXXX was not credited as a payment, resulting in my payments now showing as late, rather than on time. I first contacted the company on XXXX ( the next business day after I noticed the discrepancy ). Initially, they were unwilling to make the adjustment and told me that they had a right to first apply the payment toward the fees, rather than the mortgage. After more discussion, they found the discrepancy and assured me they would correct the billing but that it would take 7-10 business days to resolve the situation. As such, I waited to check until XXXX when I was making my next payment for the payment due on XXXX and noticed that the issue had still not been resolved. I contacted the company again, and they determined that the problem was that they had credited a partial payment entirely toward principle rather than crediting the payment as a mortgage payment and they had put the remainder toward fees. I was again assured that the issue would be corrected and I was informed that part of the problem was that I was paying early and that I should wait until the XXXX of the month to pay. I was also advised not to pay the mortgage for XXXX until XXXX. On XXXX XXXX I received my next statement in the mail that now said I owed 2 months worth of mortgage and I was charged a late fee for XXXX even though I had made the XXXX payment on XXXX. I went online to check the status since the paper statements are sometimes outdated and found that the online account reflected the same thing. I called the company again and was informed that there was a request to make the correction that was still pending. The rep stated she would check my account the next day to see if the correction had been made and that if it had still not gone through, she would correct it herself and call me the following morning. She never called. On XXXX XXXX, I again called the company and explained the entire situation. After speaking to a manager, who told me this was my fault for making partial payments ( I never made any partial payments ), she informed me she would fix the account, reverse the late fees and correctly credit my account but that I would owe an extra {$76.00} on my next payment because according to her calculations, that \\'s how much extra I owed for paying my bill incorrectly. I was incredibly frustrated but just gave up and agreed to pay the extra {$76.00} just to have this situation corrected. She also told me to wait and give the corrections a few days to go through and them make the XXXX payment. I went in today ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ) to make the payment and found that nothing has been corrected and in addition, they have reported my account as \" late \\'\\' on my credit report. So, as a result of me paying my mortgage early, I have been charged late fees, my payments have been incorrectly applied to make it look like my account is a month behind, and rather than getting a break in interest, their accounting system has set it up so that I now owe a full extra payment. Statements are attached - the statement dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 is where the discrepancies start ( XXXX_2015_Seterus_Statement ).',\n",

Ocwen mortgage services my loan and has for several year. They offered a XXXX Modification. That was the only option they offered. They said that if I sold the property or refinanced they would take a portion of the equity in the home as payment for me being able to reduce my interest rate. the reduction was only about 1 %. I asked at the time if the XXXX was based on the current value of the home or if it would be based on future value. The Ocwen rep told me it would be based on current value. When the sent me the paper work to sign a rep From Ocwen was on the phone with me at signing to go over all the details, when we got to the portion of the paperwork that discussed the XXXX amount I asked, again before I signed if it was to be based on current or future value. Once again I was told it was based on current value which would be about {$2000.00}. I signed based off of the information I was given twice by there rep. I am currently trying to refinance and cut my interest rate by more than half. When the mortgage service I am going through got the pay off from Ocwen it has an additional {$13000.00} added to it for the XXXX. When I called them to asked how it jumped to that amount they told me because of the current home value. When I asked why they were taking current value instead of the value of the home in 2013 they said because that was what the agreement stated and they refuse to lower the amount. I explained what I was told twice by THEIR rep what the amount was based on and they pretty much told me tough luck, even though their rep was supposed to know more than me and be able to answer my questions knowledgably and gave me false information. I would just have to deal with it and if I wanted to refinance that I would have to pay the extra {$13000.00}. Because that amount raises my LTV so much I am not able to have the loan refinanced because it puts me out of compliance for a new loan. So therefore I have to stay with Ocwen at a higher rate,, and payment and the more my home value increases the more they can take from me. I think when you are closing on a loan, refi or modification and you do n't understand something on the contract and you specifically asked the rep a question and are given a specific answer they should have to stick by the answer given by their rep. After all, the are the experts, not me. I feel like I have been grossly mislead and taken advantage of my Ocwen Mortgage services.\",\n",

       " 'Please associate this complaint with a prior complaint, No. XXXX. In that prior complaint, I accused Wells Fargo mortgage of circumventing the Maryland-mandated foreclosure mediation by pretending that a modification offer was forthcoming so that at mediation, there would be no discussion or negotiation, the administrative judge would report that the parties had n\\'t reached agreement. That mediation occurred on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Wells Fargo denied my modificiation, clearing the way for the court to allow a sale date to be set without meaningful mediation. Very clever and effective bait and switch. You \\'re currently investigating and Wells Fargo, who I imagine is having a hard time explaining themselves, has apparently requested an extension of time for their response. Meanwhile, I began putting together my appeal of Wells Fargo \\'s XXXX/XXXX/XXXX denials of my request under HAMP 1, HAMP 2, and as a simple internal modification. With regard to the internal modification, Wells Fargo wrote on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that \" We do not have the contractual authority to modify your loan because of limitations in our servicing agreement. \\'\\' After a few weeks of research, I learned that ( like the mediation bait and switch ) this is another maneuver Wells Fargo uses to deny modifications and streamline the taking of peoples \\' homes. It \\'s also a flat-out lie. My research led first to a XXXX article that describes how Wells Fargo uses this excuse to steamroll borrowers to the foreclosure sale. The \" investors \\'\\' that Wells Fargo is talking about are the hundreds of mortgage-backed security funds that they created in the XXXX ; the ones that crashed the national economy and were featured in \" The XXXX XXXX. \\'\\' The XXXX article pointed out that most of the time, when Wells Fargo says their agreement with the \" investor \\'\\' prohibits modification, it \\'s a lie. The article ( When Denying Loan Mods, Loan Servicers Often Wrongly Blame Investors ) can be read at XXXX. This led me to an article out of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that found that only 8 % of such agreements actually prohibited disclosure, while 60 % expressly permitted modification and 32 % were silent. So on Friday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I asked Wells Fargo for a copy of my investor agreement, a copy of the notice they sent when the sold my loan to the investor, and the investor \\'s contact information. They said I \\'d hear back in 24-48 hours. I never did. The Truth in Lending Act requires that they make this information available. Wells Fargo does n\\'t care about that, or any other, Act of Congress. So I set out alone to find the investor agreement for my \" investor, \\'\\' XXXX XXXX. Took some doing, but I found it deep in the bowels of the SEC \\'s online database. Surprise, surprise, it expressly ALLOWS modification. In fact, it REQUIRES Wells Fargo to modify if it \\'s in the best interests of the investor. So after Wells Fargo made a farce of the mediation Maryland law requires, ignored my request for investor documents as the Truth in Lending Act requires, it simply found it easier to lie about the investor agreement with the mortgage-backed security fund THEY created while they were busily destroying the economy in XXXX. The investor document, by the way, is at XXXX with the operative language starting at the bottom of page XXXX. If you could see my written appeal to Wells Fargo, you \\'d see still more information. The gist of this supplemental complaint, however, is that Wells Fargo is continuing to perpetrate outright fraud, even in the foreclosure process.

He got so flustered that I ended the call without no resolution. It was one of the worst customer services experiences I have had. Note I never once raised my voice at him. I have also been told that the payment was held due to XXXX asking for it to post on a separate date. I reached out to XXXX and they said they never told XXXX to delay payment. \\n\\nI call constantly because of the delinquency notices, the significant delays and the arbitrary dates expected post of the payment ( i.e. Tomorrow, 24 hours, one week, 30 days 60 days ).

From the day the payments are received? XXXX XXXX is the verge of affecting my credit score negatively. I work closely with a credit bureau for work and was told that these delinquency notices can adversely affect my credit score regardless of whether or not XXXX reports it.

We also had an issue with a second mortgage/line of credit that was somehow pushed through by XXXX even though we did not request this loan or complete paperwork for it. This caused a lot of XXXX in our household and combined with my XXXX it was too much and we ended up getting divorced.

After spending so much time I was FINALLY offered a modification by Nationstar about 6 months ago. However, the figures seemed way off. I asked for some clarification and an accounting of payments received, payments missed, late fees, etc. so I could understand the HUGE discrepancy. Nationstar would not provide any of this information and I told them that I did not believe the payment and balance etc. was correct and that if they could not provide documentation I could not accept this modification. After this happened Nationstar immediately started the foreclosure process and set a sale date for XX/XX/XXXX. I have now sent a Qualified Written Request to Nationstar in hopes that they will give some transparency and document the history and the accounting of this loan.

After the trial payments were completed and additional payments made the loan docs were never re-done to reflect the new loan terms. I was forced to stop payments due to the lack of new docs showing my new loan moving forward. A second loan mod package was completed again on my own. At the end of this process with a week or two left to close, my loan was sold to a different servicer. I was in shock. I started a new loan mod package with them. At t the end of this process they approved me again, however, my payment was going up more than {$1500.00} a month? At this point I was told take the deal or you will be forclosed on. Granite, my income had gone back up but I stated my income fluctuates and it will be tough to maintain that payment. They did n't care and pressured me into that mod or be foreclosed that month. A CLEAR VIOLATION OF FRANK DODD. Of course, after 12 months of payments I could not manage the payment anymore. Now after 3 years with representation, I still have no resolution. In fact, XXXX 5 months ago I challenged them on their valuation of of my property and them trying to deny my loan mod.

I am having trouble repaying the loan, and am looking for some restructuring of the debt to bring the payments lower. I had gone through the process once, and not only did it take a long time to go through, mostly because the person assigned to my case would not return my calls for assistance on the paperwork, or would as for items, and then tell me that she actually needed other documentation instead. I spent more time on back and forth, then actually sitting down to discuss options for a solution. Basically I felt like I was given the run around and in the end, told there was nothing they can do. I am a senior citizen, on a fixed income. The payments now are interest only, but will soon become P & I payments. I am behind since XXXX, and have medical issues that I need to budget my fixed income to take care of. I learned that there was actually a law suit against Wells Fargo by other customers who also went through the same situation. They found that Wells Fargo did not help those searching for assistance in a timely fashion and lost their homes to foreclosure. Another thing adding to this is the fact that my daughter was tricked into signing papers on the loan. She had power of attorney over my financials, and the loan agent at Wells Fargo told her that she was signing documents showing her power of attorney, when in fact it put her on the loan as a co-signer. Because of this her income is looked at to make decisions on my repayment ability, when in fact it should not. She has her own home and finances to worry about. This is a slimy tactic for the bank to use and now put her and my son-in-law in this mess. My son in law who also works for a bank stated to me that there are lots of programs out there that can help to modify the terms of the loan, so that the payments are manageable and I can for fill my obligation. He also stated that at his bank, they do riders and mods all the time to release parties from various loans as long as both parties sign the paperwork to do so.

In both XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, I had to file Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy due to the XXXX dragging mentality of the DVA and the MANY other discrepancies involving the Administrative/Procedural Due Process, or the LACK, thereof. <P/>I am NOT expecting everyone to kiss my behind, or \" Thank \\'\\' me for my service, due to my Veteran status, but I DO expect people to do their job. For the Record ... I do NOT live beyond my financial means. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX : Prior to being awarded XXXX, I was living on $ XXXXmo.. I had over $ 500mo in bills. I almost lost my house in XXXX XXXX, during this time & luckily, Social Security pulled through, otherwise I \\'d be homeless. <P/>The debt for that bankruptcy was DISCHARGED and an Affirmation agreement with XXXX was filed. ENTER : XXXX merges w/XXXX, not long afterwards ( XX/XX/XXXX ). <P/>Between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX : Even though I was granted XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX, most of that retro pay went towards paying XXXX back payments, Atty. fees & late fees. From then on though, my house was showing definitive signs of disrepair. I could no long make the repairs, nor could I afford to pay someone to do it. I asked the City of XXXX XXXX, XXXX for help and a housing rep determined that the house was in dire need of repair and that it would cost around {$49000.00} to bring it up to code. I also qualified for a ZERO interest loan. At that time, the housing market was way below value. Contractors bid and ALL were way over the amount estimated! After this, I made just about EVERY ATTEMPT to find someone/anyone to repair my home, but to no avail. I contacted many charitable orgs., churches, the Dept of VA ... all fell on deaf ears! <P/>My last ditch effort put me in a deeper hole. I contacted XXXX ( homeowners ins. Co. ) and after a month, they CANCELLED my policy! I had them for over 15 yrs ( Home & Auto )! That caused this downward trend to escalate. XXXX then forced me onto THEIR \" IN HOUSE \\'\\' Insurance, which later, it was found that they overcharged many people w/the same insurance. I did n\\'t partake in the class action which took place around XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. <P/>In XX/XX/XXXX, I had to do something, being that my roof was severely leaking and a ceiling in one bedroom and my kitchen had collapsed. The second bedroom was still intact, but I had to put holes to drain the water into buckets. This is NO JOKE. I have pictures that I posted online to prove this! My oil furnace always seemed to quit at/or around XXXX! I had to go into the crawl space to reprime it. My XXXX part of the house was showing green, black and white mold in the rooms effected with water leaking through. I came to a conclusion, that it was time for me to move or DIE, breathing in mold spores. <P/>In XX/XX/XXXX, the DVA \" Miraculously \\'\\' granted a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I found another house in XXXX ( current address ) and got out of this cold State. <P/>I informed XXXX of my intent to abandon the XXXX property, via letter and by phone. They insisted that I partake in a financial discussion, which I determined was their attempt to keep me in the home, after I informed them w/a \" Deed in Lieu of \\'\\'. It was determined, that XXXX took possession of the property, when someone entered the premises, threw a tarp on the roof, filled the sewer lines w/anti freeze and changed the locks. They maintained the property and paid County taxes. At least I THOUGHT they did ... <P/>From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I did n\\'t receive correspondence from ANYONE regarding the XXXX address. When out of the blue, I receive a letter from an Atty in XXXX that represented the County of residence in XXXX. <P/>It appears that XXXX, seeing the condition of the house, decided to \" surrender \\'\\' it back to XXXX XXXX. In doing so, NO ONE from XXXX informed me of their intent, so back taxes accrued, along with lot mowing fees and ( other residents ) trash dumped on the property. You can say, that I was absolutely STUMPED! <P/>I also discovered that XXXX XXXX refuses to release the Lien, unless I fork over {$1000.00}, even DURING a BK proceeding?! So, getting this house off my back & my name off the deed, is virtually impossible! <P/>After seeing that I am NOW liable for all these expenses, I had no alternative but AGAIN, filed Chapter XXXX, in hoping that I could release my self completely from this property which I had abandoned in XX/XX/XXXX! <P/>I contacted XXXX atty \\'s. out of XXXX, with the intention of getting completely released from any/all obligations from this 80 ton anchor in XXXX, XXXX, INCLUDING having my name taken off the deed! It did n\\'t turn out that way, even though during my first contact, I was promised that it would be. <P/>I ended up paying the back taxes and fees left to me by XXXX and my name is STILL on the deed. This STILL keeps me tied to this property, because I am close to CURRENT on taxes! <P/>Prior to filing the Petition in the BK Court, I insisted that I wanted to Keep my XXXX home and pay off the small loan which both were under Wells Fargo. I was told though, that by BK LAW, I had to disclose in the Petition, ALL debts and ALL assets. <P/>I was sent an inaccurate Reaffirmation Agreement to ensure to the bank, that I intended to keep the home. I noticed though, that the \" agreement \\'\\' was n\\'t accurate. The interest rate was wrong, the amount to be agreed upon was higher than it was supposed to be and the address was n\\'t accurate. I put it aside and was going to address it shortly thereafter. I was on a strict deadline to file the petition. <P/>I ALSO went to a local XXXX XXXX branch and told the account rep that even if the loan is discharged, that I wanted to keep the TRUST established with this bank and to prove it, I was willing to continue paying off the loan. While there, I voluntarily paid {$150.00} ( which I have a receipt for ) to show GOOD FAITH. What a waste of time, effort and much needed cash this turned out to be. <P/>The hearing was held. <P/>Even though I \\'m considered below the Poverty Level, for some reason, the trustee determined that I had sufficient funds to pay ( buy back ) for any outstanding debt?! <P/>Both Wells Fargo and the XXXX county tax office filed claims. This trustee also determined that an appraiser was to come to my XXXX home and list all the items that is considered of value. She did so and as I had seen, was a fair assessment! <P/>Yet, the trustee determined that I had {$5000.00} worth of value!? For exactly 12 months I had to pay {$410.00} each month, which clearly put me in a financial bind. I did so. Somehow though, this whole proceeding just does n\\'t seem quite right. <P/>WHY should I have to pay for the taxes and misc. fees incurred on a house in XXXX which I abandoned, XXXX took possession of and still, XXXX XXXX has a Lien on? AND ... WHY did Wells Fargo end up filing a claim against me for the Personal Loan, when I informed them of my intent AND paid them {$150.00} which they did n\\'t even deduct from the claim they sneakily filed!? <P/>Further ... ENTER : The Reaffirmation Agreement and the credit damage that it has caused ... It is ( at the time of this submittal ) XX/XX/XXXX, my Credit history is if I were just starting off fresh, out of High School! There are portions of it that are completely FALSE & MISLEADING! I was n\\'t aware of whos XXXX up it was, until I decided to apply for a car loan and was told that I had a \" XXXX FICA SCORE! \"? XXXX? Yes ... there \\'s NO activity on my account, even my Mortgage payments that were being made since the petition filing ... here \\'s why ... <P/>That Reaffirmation agreement which was inaccurate was FORGOT ABOUT and remained tucked in deep within my paperwork. That was MY FAULT! I had a deadline to maintain and a mountain of paperwork to file to the Court. I did n\\'t know that it was n\\'t addressed, until XX/XX/XXXX. <P/>I do n\\'t know if it \\'s Wells Fargo who failed by it \\'s inaccuracy, the ATTY OR STAFF at XXXX ( handling the BK ) or the Bankruptcy Court Clerk ( Because of the \" BK Court \\'\\' letterhead on top of page ). <P/>Regardless of who, I can not establish a Bona Fide credit standing, because Wells Fargo informed me that it was to late to correct the problem, being that the proceedings are over and the debt was DISCHARGED! However, Wells Fargo is still taking mortgage payments and NOT reporting them to the Credit Bureau. They informed me that in order to establish credit, I have an option of obtaining a Credit Card and/or going to another bank and refinance!? <P/>First, I DO NOT want any more credit cards. Second, their stupid idea of refinancing is ludicrous, being that I would have to fork over cash to complete a process, when all I wanted to do was re-establish a TRUST with this bank, despite the prank they pulled a yr or so ago! Third, HOW is anyone else going to even consider doing a \" refinance \\'\\', with my credit standing as it is today? <P/>Now I DISTRUST this bank! <P/>In conclusion ... \\nNot that I am passing blame, however, ALL of this falls under the jurisdiction of the Dept. of Veterans Affairs! The 15+ yr old claim should have been awarded as early as XX/XX/XXXX. Social Security determined that I was \" XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' XXXX in their decision ... why not the DVA?! Even though, this is n\\'t this Agencys problem, it is worth mentioning that I would n\\'t be in this financial mess if the DVA resolved the claim in an expeditious manner. <P/>So, when people at this bank \" Thanks \\'\\' me for my service, do n\\'t waste your breath! Your actions show different. _________________________________________________________________________ Issue # 2,  but not as lengthy ... Under XXXX, my Credit report shows that I owe {$49000.00}. This is NOT TRUE! I owed close to $ 40,000+/- to XXXX mortgage, which was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX merged with XXXX sometime around XX/XX/XXXX. <P/>ALL the accounts listed are CLOSED. Nor were all my mortgage debts 100 % paid off! This was not of my doing. <P/>Please forgive for the length!',\n",

XXXX turned us down for a conventional refinanced mortgage loan but offered us what they explained was a NEW program for customers that were current with their mortgage but wanted to reduce their payments. We were excited about the new program unknowing that it would hurt our credit and put our home into a foreclosure situation. Our loan officer said we were accepted into the program and our payments were being reduced approximately {$540.00} per month. We were told to make this payment for three months and the new loan would be in place after that. We asked our loan officer if the mortgage came back unacceptable could we refuse it, pay back the difference and keep the original mortgage.

It was on the Ninth month that the new mortgage plan finally came. The new mortgage plan was a disaster and we went from a 23 year mortgage to a 40 year mortgage with a balloon payment at the end. \\nFor obvious reasons we refused this new mortgage plan and continued with the existing mortgage.

This month they did it again, even though I included a letter expressing telling them to apply the extra payment to principal.

Because the two schools reporting independently to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, each school reported me as less than half time. I was unaware that a consortium had to be submitted showing half-time status between both schools. As the home school, XXXX provided me the signed consortium and I submitted to Nelnet in XX/XX/XXXX. The consortium detailed the previous semester as well as the Spring XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet confirmed with me in response to my protest that my loan should be in deferment and should have never entered payback status and the original grace periods for all of my loan should be intact. They were to un-capitalize the accrued interest and report the accurate balances to the Consumer Credit Bureaus.

XXXX has updated the XXXX XXXX XXXX database with the correct half-time status as required but Nelnet has claimed that due to inaccuracies reported in the National Student Loan Data System ( NSLDS ), they can not verify enrollment.

At first I was on a four year interest only repayment plan which was over $ XXXX/month ( that \\'s just interest! ). After that I started making payments of around $ XXXX/month. I have tried everything to get the interest rates reduced and release my cosigners but have been denied every time. I have called their Customer Service representatives ( which is a whole other complaint in and of itself, it \\'s like pulling teeth trying to deal with those mindless people ) and even took up my issues with their Office of the Customer Advocate.

Good luck! First they will try to allocate the extra funds to your next billing cycle instead of applying it to the principal balance. They literally just sat on the money I sent and took it off the next bill while my interest kept accruing. And then if you call they give you some confusing statement about why that is, and if you get them to reverse it they will spread the excess payment out across all the loans. Getting them to apply the extra funds to a specific loan is an even more difficult task. When I asked how to make this go smoothly in the future they said to send a check with the instructions for the extra funds in the memo section. Tried that, same results as before. Another call with Customer Service, another 30-40 minutes of my life wasted, another XXXX ensues. Rinse and repeat every, single, time. \\n\\nI know what they \\'re doing, they \\'re trying to XXXX around with the payment in a way that is detrimental to the customer. Why listen to their request to apply additional funds to the loan with the highest interest rate? That means they wo n\\'t get more money in the end! I \\'m happy to repay the money I borrowed but this is absolutely insane. At the rate I \\'m going I will have paid for my education several times over by the time I \\'m done with Navient.

I specifically asked about lowering my payments. After being put on hold for a brief moment, the female representative returned and said \" I have good news, you \\'re approved for a two month forbearance \\'\\' to which I replied that \\'s great. She explained to me that I was approved for a two month forbearance. She followed that by removing me off of auto-pay without my consent. I asked her when my next payment will be and she said XX/XX/XXXX. Before I got off the phone I confirmed the information again. I have a two month forbearance and my next payment will be on XX/XX/XXXX. In order to get back on auto-pay I would have to call a few weeks before the XX/XX/XXXX to give my auto-pay enough time to process. <P/>I signed up for auto-pay from day 1 of my loan. In doing so, my interest rate dropped 0.25 %. Doing this saved me money each month as well as guaranteed that I would never be late for a payment. Before XX/XX/XXXX, I  never miss a payment nor have I ever made a late payment. In fact I \\'ve always payed anywhere between {$60.00} - {$100.00} over the minimum payment. <P/>I tried to resolve the problem with XXXX XXXX by calling them on multiple occasions. Below is a list of dates when I called :XX/XX/XXXX - Inquired about payment options. Again, I \\'d like to emphasize that I never asked for a forbearance. The representative I spoke to brought it to my attention and said I was approved. I was told XX/XX/XXXX was my next payment. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - Received a voice message that was hard to understand who and what the message was about. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - Received another voice message that said my forbearance was denied. I did n\\'t think much of it because I was specifically told by a real live confirmed XXXX XXXX representative that I was approved so I thought the phone call was a scam. Not only was I approved the rep went further and removed me from auto-pay because I was approved so I had no reason to believe or no way to confirm that this voice message was actually from XXXX XXXX. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - I called Citizens Bank the lender of my loan at XXXX. I explained how I was approved for a two month forbearance, but I received a voice message saying that I was denied so, I was confused and not sure if the voice message was a scam, a real call or a robocall. The Citizens Bank representative agreed with me that my situation was odd and transferred me to XXXX XXXX representative while she remained on the line. The XXXX rep explained to me that the forbearance was denied even though I was told that it was previously approved. I was so confused. I explained to her that I did not have two months worth of payments that they were asking for. I set my budget according to what I was told. I also explained that I should not be held responsible for their mistake. If anything they should honor what they told me or try to work with me in getting the account back to good standing. I also argued that they called me after the XXXX. ( my due date each month ). In calling me after my due date my payment was going to be late regardless. The rep was not helpful. In fact she was rude and kept telling me they tried to call me. Just because they tried to call me does n\\'t remove the fact that I was told that I was approved for a two month forbearance. I asked to speak to a supervisor who I believe was not a supervisor the female rep just transferred me to another representative who told me that the rep I spoke to in XXXX made a mistake in telling me I was approved. He then told me how I should try and call the Citizens Bank since they were in charge of the loan or try to refinance. He said they were n\\'t able to do anything since they just serviced the loan. The call ended after about 1 hour with no resolution. I followed that phone call by calling Citizens Bank again in trying to see what could be done. The representative I spoke to said \" they should n\\'t be doing that. Call back and ask to speak to a supervisor. They \\'re trying to get you to refinance \\'\\' She said they were simply the originator of the loan, but XXXX XXXX should be able to help since they \\'re in charge of the loan. She told me that they should be able to help me. I called XXXX back at XXXX and asked to speak to a supervisor who again told me that they apologize but the rep I spoke to on XXXX XXXX made a mistake. I asked what could be done and was told that I had to pay or the calls and the reporting to the credit agencies would continue. I asked that the derogatory remarks be removed, but was told that they would n\\'t remove any remarks. Again, nothing was resolved after hours on the phone and multiple calls to XXXX and Citizens Bank in one day. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - I called XXXX XXXX at XXXX and had the call escalated to a supervisor after I could n\\'t get anywhere with the rep. Again, I explained that I could n\\'t make two months worth of payments and asked what could be done because I wanted to pay and understand that I have an obligation. By no means was I trying to not pay I just needed them to work with me especially since the mistake was on their part. And when they finally tried to reach me it was after my due date. The also said they sent a letter but I never received a letter. I also explained to them that even though I received a call from them it was incumbent upon me to verify who was calling me and to make sure it was n\\'t a scam. I explained how I was receiving calls from other fraudulent student loan companies that I reported to the Federal Trade Commission so, just because they said they called I had to verify that it was real. Also, I had reason to believe it was a scam because I was told I was approved onXX/XX/XXXX. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - I called XXXX XXXX and had the call escalated to a supervisor after not getting any help from the representative. Nothing was resolved. They were unwilling to work with me even though I was willing to work with them. I did n\\'t make a mistake nor have I ever made a late payment in 5 years yet they refused to lend any help or try to work with me. It should be noted that they did not call me in a timely manner. I received a voice message 3 weeks after I was approved for a two month forbearance. In calling me 3 weeks after I was approved and after my due date they put me in a position to fail. <P/>XX/XX/XXXX - I called XXXX XXXX and spoke to another supervisor again. I asked that my auto-pay be put back on so I can receive my 0.25 % reduction since I never asked for it to be removed. I explained how it \\'s unlawful to do something on my account without my account. I was told that they could n\\'t put me back on auto-pay until the account was current. Currently my payments to XXXX is {$740.00}. Before I was removed from auto-pay my payments were {$680.00} a month. So now because of their mistake I have to pay an extra over {$55.00} a month and late fees every month. I told them that I was confused how I was being penalized and asked to pay more money for a mistake that they made. Noting was resolved.

       " 'Im filing this complaint against Old National Bank of XXXX, Ind.  in order to recoup {$410.00} in overdraft charges that I incurred for a series of transactions using my debit card. The charges began XX/XX/XXXX and ended on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI have a checking and savings account with an Old National Bank branch located in XXXX, Wisconsin. My account with Old National Bank was a continuation of my account with XXXX XXXX   which was acquired by Old National Bank in XXXX of XXXX. The conversion of XXXX XXXX and its branches to Old National Bank was completed in XXXX of XXXX. \\n\\nWhen I began my account with Old National Bank in XXXX of XXXX, I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX, to discuss the details of the account. In the course of our discussion we talked about overdrafts and I pointed out to him that in addition to my checking account, I would continue my savings account which typically had a balance in excess of {$20000.00}. I asked if, in the event of an overdraft, could there be a transfer of funds from the savings account to the checking account in order to avoid overdraft fees. He said that is what would happen should an overdraft occur. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX Old National Bank offered an overdraft protection plan that I declined because of the confirmation given me by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX that an overdraft on my account would be covered by a transfer from my savings account. In declining the overdraft protection plan, Old National Bank did not inform me that now, in spite of what XXXX XXXX XXXX had told me when I opened my account, the bank would charge me for overdrafts rather than transfer funds from my savings account. \\n\\nWhen the initial overdraft occurred, Old National Bank had the discretion to deny the use of my debit card but instead allowed the transactions to continue and the charges to accumulate. I still maintain in my savings account a balance in excess of {$20000.00}, I think its only fair to expect that the bank would act on my behalf and not theirs. Overdraft charges on debit card transactions provide an opportunity for easy profit and they made the most of that opportunity. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX of Old National Bank to discuss what I felt were unfair charges. I pointed out to her what I had been told by XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding how an overdraft would be handled, and she confirmed that XXXX XXXX was correct with regard to that feature of the account. XXXX XXXX said that the reason for the overdrafts was due to the fact that I did not opt out of a provision of the account that allowed for the overdraft charges. When I asked to see my signature on a document showing that I had opted in to that provision she could not produce such a document saying that it would require research. She did not offer to find the document then and has not yet contacted me to show proof of my having agreed to a provision in for overdraft charges. \\n\\nOld National Bank is no stranger to taking advantage of its customers. In a class action suit settled in XX/XX/XXXX, Old National Bank was accused of purposefully posting debit card and ATM transactions in an order that increased depositors overdraft fees. They agreed to a {$4.00} XXXX settlement. \\n\\nThe bank in that instance showed a willingness to serve itself instead of its customers. \\nA customer should be able to trust the bank that holds its money, but Old National Bank appears to serve its own interest before its customers interest.',\n",

I mailed the payoff check with my account number on the check to US Bank to the address that I always sent my payments to. \\n\\nWell, US Bank never cashed the check. They said they never received a check. I had the receipt from the post office with the tracking number that said the check was delivered on the third day after mailing it. \\n\\nSince they never cashed the check, and I had refinanced thru XXXX XXXX, I was told by US Bank that I needed to make payments to them and at the same time make payments to XXXX XXXX. Well, that just was not a option so I made my monthly payment to XXXX XXXX since they would be my new Lien holder.. \\n\\nThe people at XXXX XXXX were very helpful and knew what was going on they wanted to help but there was nothing they could do until after a certain number of days to make sure the check was n't cashed. \\n\\nThen finally those days past, US Bank still never cashed the check. So I went to XXXX XXXX and signed a bond for them to cancel and issue a XXXX check.. \\n\\nTwo days after I signed the bond, XXXX XXXX calls me and tells me they received a letter with the check that I mailed to US Bank. The letter was addressed to me a XXXX XXXX. The reason it took so long to locate the check was because nobody with my name worked at XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nSome how they opened the mysterious letter and figured it out. The letter that was included with the returned check said they could not apply the pay off check to my loan account because I mailed the check to the account payment address and not to the pay off address. \\n\\nNow, after about three months later and finally receiving the returned check that I canceled just days before.. US Bank added several late fees and other charges to my account that I did n't feel was fair. \\n\\nHad the person that received the pay off check applied the check to the account, it would not have been late. If that person would have mailed the payoff check to the payoff address instead of returning the check to XXXX XXXX, it would not have been late. \\n\\nFinally after talking to the guy at US Bank and emailing him copies of my paperwork and payoff check, I was told that they would remove the fees that were added to the account. \\n\\nThey removed the fees but did not fix the late payments showing on my credit reports. On my credit report it shows the account status as a PAID CHARGE OFF. But it was not a charge off, it was paid off and all payments were on time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, four years later it still shows as a CHARGE OFF, so I disputed the charge off. Now, the updated the status from charge off a few years ago. Now it says CHARGE OFF IN XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nI tried again this month to dispute the charge off.

The trustee for the bankruptcy ordered me to pay the minimum amount on the \" pic a pay \\'\\' mortgage resulting in negative amortization. I made all of the court ordered payments to the trustee for arrears ( my only required repay was to Wells Fargo who owned the mortgage as a result of buying the bank that had financed the house ) and the regular monthly mortgage payment to Wells Fargo. During the sixty month term of the chapter XXXX, Wells Fargo would not allow online payment or automatic deduction. I was forced to call every month to make the mortgage payment for a fifteen to thirty minute call including hold time, monthly redundant questions regarding contact info, etc..

I went to both credit unions that I made the phone call payments from and received printouts of the payments to Wells Fargo in less than an hour ( including travel and wait times ).

Perhaps, they are seeking revenge for the junior lien ( second mortgage ) being stripped upon my chapter XXXX exit. If I am behind in any payments, I have never been notified.

There was no sign or any message that the machine was out of service. \\nThe machine took all my info including a {$3.00} fee and then informed me that it was \" unable to process \\'\\' my request. I went into the branch and was informed they were aware the machine was OOS and were awaiting a technician to make repairs. I requested a sign be posted but was told the technician was on the way. An hour later on my 4th trip to Suntrust there was still no info to let the customer know the machine was out of service. Had there been a notice none of this would have happened. \\nI then went to another branch and the ATM there informed me I had \\'insufficient \\' funds to complete the transaction. I then returned home and checked on line my XXXX   account and was surprised that, with the conversion, XXXX  had debited C {$960.00} from my account. I then returned to the XXXX XXXX branch and talked to the assistant mgr who informed me the problem was with my XXXX XXXX  and not the fault of Suntrust, and that I should contact my XXXX XXXX  and lodge a complaint. \\nI didn\\'t believe her, and returned home, called the XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and even though they or myself didn\\'t believe that XXXX was responsible, set up a fraud complaint file and advised me to return to Suntrust and re talk with them. On my fourth trip to Suntrust the asst. mgr still insisted the problem was with my XXXX XXXX and not Suntrust. I explained that Suntrust ATM didn\\'t dispense my {$700.00} because it was \\'unable to process \\' but electronically informed XXXX that it did and XXXX   sent Suntrust {$700.00} from my XXXX checking account. This totals $ XXXX that Suntrust now had. This has caused me to miss my first mortgage payment in eight years. \\nI talked to Mgr XXXX four times, but was told today Suntrust is set up for the defrauded customer to have to do the fighting with the bank from where the funds were taken from ; NOT Suntrust ATM that failed to dispense the funds as Suntrust does not service their machines. \\nThat means Suntrust takes no responsibility for their errors and places the onus on the consumer/customer to suffer. \\nWith four employees inside who knew the ATM was OOS, why did not one of them  place a sign on the ATM? Would it have been too much of an effort to do so? \\nI can only guess it would have been even though I requested a notice be placed on the machine. Over an hour later there was still no notice on the ATM. With the popularity of that branch, I can only imagine how many customers have been inconvenienced and have lost money by the lack of management responsibility and Suntrust policy.',\n",

In the meantime, recertifying an income-driven repayment plan was nearly impossible as the company had no capability of calling internationally to inform its international clients that a document was received or was in good order. Instead, a determination was made that my recertification was not properly handled and so FedLoan recommended that I go into forebearance deferment in order to give THEM time to process my recertification application. After this, the interest on my loan was capitalized and when I complained they claimed that this was my fault rather than their fault for not having efficient means for international clients to recertify income-driven repayment.

       " 'I have applied for Chase Freedom credit card and was denied because \" Too many credit cards opened in the last 2 years. \\'\\' I feel this is a discriminating policy against divorced people ( I got divorced last year ). During a divorce the parties are forced to close credit cards that are issued on both names and open new cards with de-novo credit inquiry and credit check. There is no way around it, the accounts have to be closed and new credit cards ( CC ) have to be issued. Even though I have had another CC with Chase for 10 years with no late payments and no carryover balance ever on the account and even thought I was approved for house refinancing twice after the divorce and was approved for about XXXX CC, Chase had denied my application. When I called to depute the issue, I got to talk to XXXX ( the senior support specialist ) and he was no help. He kept putting me on defensing by constantly asking why do I feel that Chase discriminates divorced people. Instead of giving me any solution to the situation I was forced to defend why I felt the way I was. XXXX did n\\'t tell me when I can reapply and what is an acceptable amount of CC that could be opened in the past 2 years. I feel this is an unfair policy that is discriminating against divorced people, and yes I know that Chase was n\\'t notified of my divorce, but anyone knows that divorced people will have too many CC opened in their name right after the divorce, and I do n\\'t know about another group of people that is going to have a lot of CC opened in a short period of time.

       " \"1. We purchased our home in XX/XX/XXXX knowing that our mortgage payment would be {$3800.00} monthly, which was already at the top of our budget. In late XXXX or early XX/XX/XXXX we received a notice stating that starting XX/XX/XXXX our mortgage payment would be {$3300.00} based on an escrow reanalysis. We called Quicken Loans at the time to confirm if that was correct and they said it was. For the last seven months we have been paying {$3300.00} monthly until the following occurred. \\n\\n2. I contacted our loan servicer, Quicken Loans on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX to ask for basic information regarding the refinancing process hoping to get rid our mortgage insurance that comes with an FHA loan. The representative that I spoke with asked me if she could run my credit score in order to give me information regarding refinancing loans. My concern was that I did not want a hard credit check because I was just trying to get basic information. She assured me that this credit check would not affect my credit score. I called back later and spoke to a supervisor and she confirmed that it was indeed a hard credit check and had thus decreased my credit score. Additionally, I learned that she had ran my wife 's credit as well without my knowledge or permission, causing her credit score to decrease as well. \\n\\n3. As a result of my call, it was brought to my attention that Quicken Loans had made a huge mistake in determining the correct amount of the property tax on my new home. As I mentioned earlier, they did an escrow reevaluation and lowered the amount that was collected through no fault of our own. This amount was insufficient to pay the property tax and we now owe almost {$6000.00}. This is a large amount of money and we are in fear of losing our home. Quicken loans informed us that we would have to pay a mortgage payment of {$4200.00} to {$4400.00} a month as a result of this mistake. This is an increase of almost {$1000.00} compared to what we are currently paying. They have not provided us with any assistance on how to correct this issue other than saying we owe the amount. \\n\\n4. A mortgage banker from Quicken Loans contacted my wife yesterday,XX/XX/XXXXto provide her with refinancing information given that they had already ran our credit. He told her that if we refinanced, we wouldn't have to pay mortgage insurance. I contacted an acquaintance that is in the mortgage industry and we went through the information that I was given. He brought up several points that concerned him and myself : A. No mortgage insurance with a refinancing loan is incorrect. The mortgage insurance is simply rolled into the loan instead of being separate. That was the first lie. \\n\\nB. She was also told that they recommended refinancing otherwise our payment will be increased to the {$4200.00} to {$4400.00} I mentioned above which feels like extortion. \\n\\nC. The mortgage banker gave my wife an approximation of what our payment would be if we refinanced through them which was done by valuing our house at an unrealistically high amount. \\n\\nD. They paid the property tax back in XXXX and overlooked the fact that our mortgage payment was insufficient to cover the corrected property tax amount and yet did nothing to inform us of the problem until we contacted them nearly two months later.\",\n",

This occurred after we submitted and resubmitted at least 5 separate modification requests with them from XXXX to XXXX.

We decided to sell our home and downsize. We recently found a buyer for our home and began the selling process. As we neared the end of the process, we were hit with a shocking bit of news. Apparently our 80/20 loan had been broken apart and the 2nd loan was either written off or  bundled/sold back to XXXX, unbeknownst to us. That loan has been floating around out in the mortgage universe and is currently a huge barrier for us in trying to sell our home. \\n\\nDuring our modification process, we requested and Chase affirmed that our 80/20 loan would be consolidated into a single loan. This topic was discussed numerous times over the course of 4+ years. The final principal balance calculation in the modification agreement was relatively close to our original loan amount of {$170000.00} for both loans ( # XXXX and # XXXX ).  The principal balance was around {$180000.00} plus additional interest, fees and a deferred principal amount for a total of {$210000.00} all under one loan # XXXX.

Chase referred us to XXXX, who says they can not speak to us because they have transferred the loan to XXXX for collection. XXXX says they can not release the lien unless the {$51000.00} is paid.

How long will it take? \\n\\nIf the 2nd loan # XXXX ( currently owned by XXXX & serviced by XXXX ) is a valid loan, 1 ) Did Chase write off Loan # XXXX and if so, when? \\n2 ) What is Chases practice for writing off a home loan?\\n\\n3 ) How did the original principal amount of {$130000.00} on 1st Loan #  XXXX result in a loan modification amount of {$210000.00}?

       " \"My parents ( now deceased ) took out a Reverse Mortgage wit h Genworth  which is  nor Liberty Home Equity Solutions ( Liberty HES ) i n  XXXX . At that time they were supposed to have the required HECM HUD Mortgage Counseling which I believe they did not have and I have evidence to prove that they did not. At that time their mortgage on the house had been fully paid off for years, there was substantial equity in the property and they had excellent retirement income and excellent credit. I believe they were misled and deceived about the risks and the nature of the loan and were not shown other less risky alternatives. From  XXXX  to   XXXX   XXXX   my mother was handling all of the finances my father had become legally  XXXX  and when she became ill and hospitalized in  XXXX  my father appointed me as his Power or Attorney.Then I discovered numerous documents with many serious discrepancies and I began requesting documents from  Liberty HES and reviewing their bank account information. My mother died in   XXXX   XXXX   and my fa ther in   XXXX   XXXX  , after which I was appointed as the Estate Personal Representative (  XXXX  ) and as sole heir, I continued to request documents from  Liberty HES a nd they would not cooperate even requiring each time I send their death certificates and my personal representative documents without receiving the documents. There were very significant discrepancies of amounts due for the payoff and a lack of accounting for charges in excess of {$80000.00} . Six wee ks after my father 's   XXXX    Liberty HES  started sending collection letters. As sole heir from   XXXX   to  XXXX , I made several offers which  Liberty HES re jected. My husband and I were approved for a mortgage in    XXXX   XXXX    and were to sign and pass papers in approx. a week when he unexpectedly suddenly   XXXX   on the way to his work of a massive  XXXX   XXXX . Shortly after  Liberty HES s ent notices of foreclosure.  Liberty HES  has failed to negotiate and has not provided requested documents. I have an  XXXX  mortgage counseling original form signed by th e counselor but  unsigned by my parents that have their names typed in with my mother 's name misspelled. As I lived our home and took care of them and I had the only vehicle I would have had to make any appointments for them and take them for any counseling sessions which did not occur. In only some of the documents I have requested, I recently received a photocopy of the counseling form which has my parents alleged signatures on it but my father 's signature, in particular, does not appear authentic ( in both my sister and my opinion ). Therefore, I contacted the  XXXX  Counseling agency and was told that the agency can not provide a copy of the counseling certificate signed by my parents. Further, on the mortgage documents fro m Genworth, it stat es the counseling fees were waived. Among documents I have found there are pages that state certain conditions and aspects of the Reverse Mortgage which are simply not true of the Mortgage agreement they signed and I believe these text pages were used to deceive my parents about the nature of the loan. Many pages of the mortgage document initial agree ment, Loan docume nts are missing required signatures and or initialing or have initialing in particular by my father that do not appear authentic in that he always wrote in cursive and the letter shapes do not appear typical of his writing. Further, the signing of the mortgage itself was done at our home and involved onl y two men from Genworth being  there, my son and myself were home at that time, no one else came or went from the house here in Massachusetts. Yet in the mortgage documents a specific female person who went before a  Notary Republic in   XXXX  California to swear and attest that she witnessed the signing of the Mortgage loan documents and verified the identification of the signing mortgages and that she submitted proof of this. No female person came to the house during that day at all before during or after the signing of the documents and there was no photocopy machine in our home so no copies of picture ID driver 's licenses could have been made in any case. Therefore, the  Notarized witnessi ng is fraudulent and why was it done in California not here in Massachusetts where the alleged signing occurred and where the property is located? There are numerous missing signatures and or seals that were required on documents in copies I have found or received. An FHA required signature and seal is blank i n one document. There is a loan   document that states the total loan amount as {$530000.00}. when the house was appraised at {$330000.00}. at that time in  XXXX , and which we believe that appraisal was highly inflated as the housing market had crashed. In fact, the current   XXXX   XXXX   appraisal is the same {$330000.00}. amount as that. The original purpose of the loan was to replace the furnace, hot water heater, repair replace the chimney, repair the roof, and put in thermal energy efficient windows. A second mortgage or home improvement loan could have been easily obtained based on the equity their finances and their excellent credit ratings rather than a variable interest Reverse Mortgage high-risk loan that had administrative fees and interest costs of approx. $  XXXX . I do not believe my father the principle owner would have agreed to this predatory loan if he had had the required HECM counseling. Our home ( now my home ) was built in  XXXX  by my grandfather and my father was born in this home, I have lived in my home for the majority of my life having once moved out but returned to help my parents as they became older and developed some increasing medical problems. Myself I am  XXXX  as determined by  U.S. SSA and  now have a limited income under their  XXXX  Widow 's benefit. I have contacted every free legal aid clinic, agency organization known to man and thus far have not been able to obtain any help.  In   XXXX   XXXX   Liberty HES attempted a   foreclosure auction for which I had to file a personal bankruptcy to stop, however, due to inclement weather and my  XXXX  and an illness I suffered at that time I did could not obtain my mail and missed a required documents filing deadline so that bankruptcy was dismissed. Following the   XXXX   XXXX   property assessment,  Liberty HES  sent letters of non-adjudicated foreclosure and impending foreclosure auction of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . On Thursday,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   through advice and help of a friend I filed a petition request pleading for the MA  XXXX   Superior Court to issue  a court injunction stay of the foreclosure /auction, however, the judge said there was not enough evidence and that  Liberty HES had to r eceive notification so he set another court date for Monday,   XXXX   XXXX   at   XXXX   XXXX   the day before the auction. Based upon that I found it necessary to re-file a chapter  XXXX  bankruptcy in  XXXX  on the next day Friday,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . On Monday the  Liberty HES attorney had the  court remove the injunction hearing due to the bankruptcy. In the meantime, I have met with a local state representative who urged me to file a complaint with the MA Attorney  Generals Office CARD division which I have  done yesterday   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , and they have provided the names of some legal aid agencies to contact and I am in process of doing so today although, I have previously contacted these entities without getting any help prior. Additionally, through the bankruptcy filing, I have filed a subpoena  to Liberty HES for true c opies of the Reverse Mortgage and all related documents. Through the same bankruptcy court, I have requested that the accounting of the mortgage debt amount be performed and I am requesting that the court help me to obtain legal representation. My ultimate goal is to have the courts determine the validity of any and all debt and to assist or require that a payment plan that is affordable be put into place for repayment of any amount if any that is truly due so that I can keep my lifetime home. Debt Collection harassment : In addition to numerous mailed documents the  Debt collection activities started only 6 weeks after my father 's death when I believe there was supposed to be a 3-month delay to allow the heir to obtain financing to keep the home. Further in the latest threatening letter from the Liberty HES it alleges the loan amount was {$530000.00}. and that they would sue me for any deficiency after the auction. As far as I can determine my parents only received approximately {$200000.00}. and that there are about {$90000.00} to {$100000.00} of unspecified administrative and interest fees added on. The Reverse Mortgage states that the mortgagee 's and or their heirs are not to be charged for to have any attempt at collecting a deficiency. As this is a FHA loan Liberty HES would receive FDA insurnace payment for any difference between the auction sale amount and the full appraised value. This and other occurrences amount to harassment by the Lender and their attorney collection agencies.\",\n",

       " \"Predatory lending is any lending practice that imposes unfair or abusive loan terms on a borrower. It is also any practice that convinces a borrower to accept unfair terms through deceptive, coercive, exploitative or unscrupulous actions for a loan that a borrower doesn't need, doesn't want or can't afford. This is exactly what XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Beneficial ) is guilty of in the case of my now deceased parents, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. CFPBs job is to protect consumers from this type of abuse when it is reported. I ask that CFPB hold Beneficial, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX accountable for their unconscionable actions. Although too late for my parents, I hope appropriate action by the authorities will prevent thousands of other consumers from being financially destroyed by these unscrupulous and repulsive financial and servicing institutions. Background : On XX/XX/XXXX loan # XXXX was established between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the principle amount of {$32000.00}. The term of the loan was for 180 months with an astonishing high interest rate of 17.895 % ( Risk Based Pricing ). After reviewing the documentation regarding this loan provided by Beneficial, I have discovered the following unethical, or even perhaps illegal discrepancies. Discrepancy # 1 : Beneficial states, Please note that we are unable to provide the origination Appraisal for loan # XXXX ( formerly XXXX ) as it is not available. Therefore, Beneficial unethically lent money to a consumer without an appraisal for a property they were seeking a security interest in? I constitute that as predatory, or at least negligent. Discrepancy # 2 : On the Loan Repayment and Security Agreement ( Page 1 of 3 ), the property address is listed as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX, with the loan number being XXXX. This is neither the correct loan number nor is the property address zip code for XXXX XXXX, its XXXX. Note Beneficial states, You are giving us a security interest in the real estate located at the above address. This cant be the case, as that address does not exist. Discrepancy # 3 : The Truth-In-Lending Disclosure ( Page 1 of 2 ) contains the wrong address and loan number. Also, the Annual Percentage rate is an astonishing 19.001 % ( predatory ). Discrepancy # 4 : Loan Summary page contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 5 : XXXX XXXX credit report contains the wrong birthdates of both my parents. They ran a report for my father as XXXX XXXX. His name is XXXX XXXX, not XXXX XXXX and wrong birth date. They even disregarded four ( 4 ) XXXX alerts on the report. Instead of running a credit report for my mother ( co-signer ), they erroneously ran a credit report for a XXXX XXXX. The report had wrong name, wrong SS #, wrong birthdate and wrong address. Discrepancy # 5 : The Good Faith Estimate ( Page 1 of 2 ) did not disclose all charges. In all, they were charged {$1800.00} of excessive fees. Discrepancy # 6 : Title report was ran by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on property with Deed dated XX/XX/XXXX,  recorded XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Page 770. This is the legal description used in both the note and mortgage filed in XXXX County, NY. On XX/XX/XXXX loan # XXXX ( which is crossed out and replaced with XXXX ) was established between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the principle amount of {$62000.00}. The term of the loan was for 240 months with an astonishing high interest rate of 11.540 % ( Risk Based Pricing/Loan Flipping ), with the following discrepancies : Discrepancy # 1 : Loan Repayment and Security Agreement ( Page 1 of 3 ) contains the wrong property address. Again, they state, You are giving us a security interest in the real estate located at the above address. Thats impossible, because it is incorrect. Discrepancy # 2 : The Truth-In-Lending Disclosure ( Page 1 of 3 ) contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 3 : The Loan Summary contains the wrong property address. Discrepancy # 4 : The credit reports ran contain the wrong birthdates of my parents. XXXX alerts were discarded. Discrepancy # 5 : The Good Faith Estimate contains the wrong property address, as well as discloses misleading, repetitive and excessive fees that my parents were charged for just six months earlier. Discrepancy # 6 : The Settlement Statement contains the wrong property address and charges my parents an astonishing {$4100.00} in settlement charges. This totals a sum of {$6000.00} in charges over a six-month period. Discrepancy # 7 : Title report was ran by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on property with Deed dated XX/XX/XXXX, recorded XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Page 770. This is the legal description used in both the note and mortgage filed in XXXX County, NY. Discrepancy # 8 : The Uniform Residential Appraisal Report does not match the legal description of the deed ran by the Title Company. Also, it only states the address as XXXX and later in the report as XXXX XXXX. XXXX. Discrepancy # 9 : The Mortgage and Consolidation Agreement attached contain the wrong property address. The zip code for XXXX is listed as XXXX. XXXX zip code is XXXX. Discrepancy # 10 : The Optional Credit Insurance Disclosure contains the wrong address. The loans listed above were then consolidated by Beneficial on XX/XX/XXXX in the sum of {$110000.00} and riddled with similar discrepancies and fraudulent behavior, which I have previously reported to no avail. After my parents passing, Beneficial fraudulently sold these deficient and unenforceable loans to XXXX XXXX XXXXt XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and transferred the serving to XXXX. XXXX and XXXX continue to try to enforce these unenforceable loans and threaten my parents estate with foreclosure. I would like to see the appropriate action taken against these institutions and for them to admit their wrongdoings and cease and desist their present actions. It is obvious Beneficial partook in predatory, unethical and fraudulent behavior and took advantage of my parents unsophisticated and uneducated financial literacy. Beneficial has the documentation I have cited, as they provided it to me. They need to be held accountable, cure the loans with XXXX and discharge the erroneous records filed in XXXX   County, NY Land Records. As such, on behalf of my parents estate, I continue to dispute all alleged debt associated with XXXX account XXXX. I am fully prepared to litigate this matter should it become necessary.\",\n",

First off, I did not receive one phone call regarding this account by XXXX or Waypoint until my credit had a derogatory mark placed on it. I did not receive one written communication from either.

The call recordings are recorded im sure, as well as documentation on there end of all collection attempts phone or written. The next step I will take if Waypoint doesnt stop all collection attempts and fix any credit marks is hiring an attorney and subpoena those collection efforts. There wont be any real attempts, because like I stated I havent received one phone call or written communication from XXXX or Waypoint. The only communication was a phone call placed by me to Waypoint XX/XX/XXXX.

       " \"My bank will not cancel my PMI on a 30 year conventional loan despite a proper request. I first requested it be cancelled several years ago and I understood I had to have 20 % equity. We paid about {$500.00} for an appraisal and it was around the 20 % equity threshold. We received a letter rejecting our request from the bank stating we needed 25 % equity. Where did this arbitrary threshold come from? We had no known recourse. \\n\\nSecond, I recently again requested PMI be cancelled. We paid about {$500.00} for a 2nd appraisal and this time we clearly have at least 20 % equity. However, in the interim, and for the first time ever in the almost 10 years I 've had this loan, we accidently paid the mortgage 1 day late. Let me explain - my daughter was very ill and we were focused on that and did n't pay on time. I realized the error on the last day of the month ( payment is late if it is not paid by the end of the month due ) and called the mortgage company to explain what happened and went online and paid that day when it was still timely. However, it was already in the evening and the payment could not be processed until the following day, making the payment 1 day late. Based on paying 1 day late we now have to wait an entire year before we can again request PMI can be cancelled so that we have a year of on time payments. I called the bank and asked them to reconsider as a courtesy and explained it was a one-time error due to extreme family circumstances ; I posted a payment timely, called to explain the situation and explained the situation online, but the payment did n't process until the following day. They declined and are still requiring we continue to pay PMI. \\n\\nThrough paying for 2 appraisals and the continued cost of the PMI for at least another year, we are out about {$2200.00}.\",\n",

Claim after claim about how Nationstar had taken over a great many loans under the XXXX program and had been either adjusting escrow amounts or increasing interest rates but not informing customers as to reflect delinquent accounts and position themselves for foreclosing on these loans. \\n\\nWhen I was able to reach Nationstar on Monday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX I spent three hours on the phone being transferred back and forth to various departments. The first person I spoke with told me that the interest rate on my loan increased in XXXX of XXXX. When asked how they informed me of this change, she said her records indicated that a letter was sent on XXXX XXXX. I received no such letter. My monthly statements never reflected a short fall in my monthly payments either. Then she told me that my interest rate increased again in XXXX of XXXX She said XXXX letter was issued in XXXX of XXXX informing me of the increase. Again, no such letter was received and my monthly statements did not reflect a deficient payment. I received no such letter. My monthly statements never reflected a short fall in my monthly payments either. \\n\\nIt seems that they did raise the rates, however I was never informed of these increases. At matter now, is that no one can tell me accurately how much I need to pay to bring the account current. Of the XXXX people I spoke to XXXX indicated {$140.00}, another {$180.00}, and another {$910.00}. I have requested that they send me a bill and documentation that will show me how much is owed and where it will be applied. They assured me they would send me an email in XXXX48 hours. It is now XXXX XXXX, XXXX and I have received no written correspondence from Nationstar. I desperately need your help to get a clear and honest answer about what is owed. This is my home and this mortgage company is behaving like a predatory lender hoping that the longer they delay the closer they get to a foreclosure process. I have lived in my home for 25 years, and I have never made a late payment, not once. I am shocked, appalled and frankly terrified that this is happening and I am seemingly vulnerable to their practices.\",\n",

       " 'I have filed this complaint 3 times now. with the CFPB. All I get is a standard letter full of more lies from Ocwen. We were told on numerous occasions that our past due taxes would be included in our payment and it said it in our modification paperwork that we signed. On SEVERAL occasions an Ocwen representative told us that our modification would include our past taxes. Well they LIED. If we were told the truth we would of negotiated it differently. I believe that is a violation of UDAAP. I specifically said that \" I was glad that the past taxes would be included as we could not afford to pay them in addition to the new modified loan payment. \\'\\' They have that recorded message also. Our modification papers that we signed said that the new principal balance includes all amounts and arrearages that are past due. The everyday American would believe that include their taxes if they are past due ESPECIALLY when the lender has assured and reassured them ( us ) that it did. But they are crooks and apparently crooks can get away with what ever they like. Oh, and the debt forgiveness, we were told was supposed to be a specific amount each year for 3 years. That was an other lie. They violated the law and nailed us with the entire amount all in one year. I will be alerting the IRS about that as well. If you cant believe what your lender tells you and puts in writing then there is a problem. So were are CC\\'ing our congressmen and women starting with   XXXX   XXXX   asking them for help and to pass a law to STOP lenders with violating the law. I \\'m tired of Ocwen paying their way out of being held responsible. They need to be held responsible to their customers.\\n<P/>\\nOcwen is in violation of UDAAP-Unfair Deceptive Abusive Acts & Practices. They bought our loan and reassured us a number or times that our past taxes would be included in the new modified loan amount. They also went as far to say that the only way the payment would go up was if our property taxes went up. We have a 23 year fixed loan on a Shared Loan Modification plan with Ocwen. For the first year our payment stayed the same as it should because its a fixed loan. The following 3+ years our payment went up more than {$850.00} a month. Upon further investigation we found that a ) they were charging us for taxes that were previously collected by our prior lender thus double dipping, & b ) they are also charging us for taxes that they told us several times would be included in the new loan amount, we have proof.\\n<P/>\\nThis has caused us substantial monetary injury due to this unfair practice. Ocwen has notified us ( we have proof ) that it will continue to go up, thus eventually forcing us out of our home which we believe was their end game to begin with. We could not avoid this injury since the material information about the pricing was modified and or withheld after we committed to the purchasing of the product therefore unable to avoid the injury.\\n<P/>\\nOcwen also charged us for 18 property inspections totalling {$180.00} and 6 valuations totalling {$650.00} for a grand total of {$840.00}. An Ocwen representative sent us the paperwork with all of this information on it when we complained about not receiving a copy of our appraisal for over a year. We had to file a complaint with the CFPB in 2015 to legally get a copy of our appraisal from Ocwen. Upon further investigation of the Ocwen sent document we noticed that they applied our first 3 mortgage payments but then reversed the last payment as if they never received it. So it appears as if we only made 2 payments when we made three. This amount is {$3600.00}. Since I started this letter Ocwen has credited us for the misplaced payment but still owes us lates fees and interest they charged us for the four years that THEY lost our payment and want this money back! OCWEN told us that they would open a ticket and look into this that was 60 days ago with no further contact. At the time this was going on Ocwen was being sued in Federal Court. We found this out after the fact or we would of put in a claim for fraudulent fee charges.\\n<P/>\\nTo rectify this matter this is what needs to happen. Ocwen will refund us for the following in the form of a check 1. ) {$180.00} -- for the  XXXX  inspections  XXXX  -- for the  XXXX  evaluations -- totaling &  XXXX . We want a check issued to us. They have charged us more than this on a monthly bassi on a fixed loan for the last 3 years considering they have fraudulently increased our payment now {$850.00} a MONTH! We work hard for our money and want it back 2. ) Regarding the misapplied mtg. amt. of {$3600.00} that was just applied to our loan.- and was lost for 4 years we want all late fees and interest that we paid on an inaccurate balance credited back to us. We more interest for 4 years on a payment they lost. We want detailed notarized proof.\\n<P/>\\n3. ) Regarding property taxes ; we had an escrow account with our past lender and now Ocwen is telling us we owe them for those taxes. That is double dipping and illegal but they are doing it knowing that the only option we have is to pay it or go back into Foreclosure which is their end game we believe. There are also past taxes that we were assured several times from Ocwen that would be included in the new loan, their paperwork even says this and they are hitting us for those as well. By our accounting and a third party would need to check this. They owe us {$14000.00} approx.\\n<P/>\\nGrand total {$16000.00} and we want a refund To all congressmen and women reading this. We have a suggestion. Since Ocwen does n\\'t mind being fined millions of dollars I propose the following ; have the public police them. Every time one of their customers finds an error that Ocwen has to pay it back 10 fold ( ten times the offense ) to the borrower up to a certain dollar amount and after that dollar amount Ocwen needs to pay off the loan on the home ( not showing it as a write off that would negatively affect the owner ) thus buying the borrower their home. Maybe, just maybe if their millions of borrowers were watching their every move they would conduct their business legally esp. if they ran the risk of loosing the notes by paying them off in the borrowers behalf. I know it sounds crazy but considering their track record its not really that crazy.',\n",

Also, online access and convenient payment options weren't available to me but only by driving an hour or more depending on my location to post a payment.

When I received my monthly mortgage statements, it showed the payments and where those monies had been applied. \\nThen, after the entire process was over, I received a statement which showed that most of the funds which had been previously \" applied \\'\\' were now \" unapplied \\'\\', and there was NO accounting for these funds anywhere on my statement. The total amount of funds which were unaccounted for was {$1200.00}. \\nWhen I called to find out about the \" missing funds \\'\\', I was told that they would need to do further research. Then I received a letter stating that those funds had been used to pay for back interest and escrow as stated in the loan modification agreement. So I called back and asked why this was never shown on my mortgage statements. I was told that those funds were part of the loan modification process, and would not show up on the mortgage statements. \\nSo this is my concern ... how can a mortgage company ( or bank ), receive monies from you for a mortgage, and not explain where your funds are being applied. I made several phone calls to Chase Bank, and got the same information each time. \\nAnd while I understand that I owed for back interest and escrow during the \" trial period \\'\\', I was NEVER informed of exactly how much that was, nor was it ever shown on ANY of my mortgage statements. I have to question why the funds were applied during the trial period process, and then unapplied later. And why do those funds NEVER get accounted for on ANY of my future statements. As a consumer, I deserve to know where those funds have gone. \\nIn addition, shortly after the loan modification process was completed, my monthly payments were reduced again after an escrow analysis was done for my account. However, my current escrow balance is now ( - {$420.00} ) as of my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement. \\nThis shortage occurred due to an increase in my homeowner \\'s insurance policy. My policy increased from {$1500.00} in XX/XX/XXXX to {$1600.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. That is only a {$25.00} increase, so there is no way that their escrow analysis should have been that far off. In addition, if the previously mentioned funds were applied to back interest and escrow, why were there not enough funds applied to the escrow account? And how could the escrow analysis had that much of a discrepancy? \\nI would like to know exactly where these \" missing funds \\'\\' ( {$1200.00} ) were applied, and exactly how it was determined where those funds would be applied. Also, I would like to receive updated statements to reflect exactly where and how those monies were applied. \\nI feel it is extremely unfair to me, as a consumer, to not be made aware of where these monies are being applied as it pertains to my current mortgage. ALL of this information should be available on my monthly statements. I do not understand how a mortgage company servicer ( or bank ) can apply and then unapply your payments, and then not be required to inform the consumer of where exactly those funds went.',\n",

Following are the specific details : 1. Ms. XXXX XXXX, a Home Lending Executive Office specialist, Ph. XXXX, ext. XXXX, was communicating with me by phone concerning my original complaint XXXX. She was my single and only contact, handling my case with the Recast Department, and updating me on my case status. ( Customers have no direct access to the Recast personnel. ) 2. The intended resolution stated on a letter Chase sent me on XX/XX/XXXX was that Chase will honor the recast agreement I executed with Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, which will reduce my mortgage payments from {$220.00} to {$200.00} retroactively, and credit/refund me the accumulated difference in payments. \\n3. On XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX  back to Chase this XX/XX/XXXX letter with its enclosed Recast Acceptance Form as instructed. \\n4. I alerted Ms. XXXX on one of our initial telephone conversations in XX/XX/XXXX that I will be leaving the country and my mail will be held from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, therefore all documents Chase requires me to execute must be delivered to my home address by XX/XX/XXXX, or by email after my departure date. Ms. XXXX assured me that the procedure will be done prior to my deadline, and I am to receive the new agreement by mail within a week. The first documents from Chase were actually Fedexed to me nearly a month later. \\n5. I contacted Ms. XXXX upon receiving the letter with the acceptance form on or about XX/XX/XXXX to remind her about my overseas trip and to raise my concern about a second set of documents I expect the Recast Department to send me to complete this procedure, ( which I have previously required to execute on XX/XX/XXXX ). Ms. XXXX assured me there is no other documents to be sent to me, and that any further communications from Chase will be sent to my email address. \\n6. My XXXX and XXXX mortgage statements have already been closed with no sign for the application of the recast terms. \\n7. Two weeks ago, on XX/XX/XXXX, I left Ms. XXXX a voice message to let her know that Chase has not executed my recast terms yet, that she misinformed me about the process completion with the return of my Recast Acceptance Form, and that I am certain there is a second set of documents sent to me by Chase after my departure, which holds the process stuck in limbo until my return, and that I didn't receive any emails from Chase Mortgage or Recast departments. \\n8.
